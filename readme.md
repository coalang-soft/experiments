## Experiments
There already are many repositories in this organisation. But what happens if there is a (maybe) great idea that should be saved and
shared with others? It is not a good idea to create a repository for every single "idea-file". So this experiments repository collects
them.

### What can I find here
* CoaLang - new, not yet implemented concepts and ways to do some things in other ways than usual.
* Other languages - concepts for new languages, not necessarily for programming. Like AppTML and MyLambda.
* Many other things. Basically anything can be here.
